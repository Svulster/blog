# Here we go again
Started a while ago, but the blog kind of halted before it had begun. 
I have been using Obisidan for a while, and since it is a convenient way to visualise markdown I decided to try to use it to update the blog.
I'm not sure this is somehting I would like to spend a lot of time and energy on, but it is nice to try new things from time to time.
